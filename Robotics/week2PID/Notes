Which term in a PID controller primarily helps to eliminate steady-state error?
                    : Integreal


Increasing the proportional gain Kp generally:
                    : Inceases system responce but may increace overshoot


The derivative term Kd in a PID controller:
                    : Predicts system behaviour to improve stability
