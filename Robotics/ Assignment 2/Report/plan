Abstract (write last)

Once you've finished everything else, summarise these five points in ~160 words:

Scenario problem – Robot needs to follow a human safely in an industrial environment.

Approach – LiDAR-only perception + reactive control (no planning).

Techniques – ROS 2 nodes, finite state machine, safety thresholds.

Evaluation – How well the robot followed, stopped, safety metrics.

Ethics/legal – Why safe spacing and predictable motion matter.

Conclusion – Robot worked, limitations found, future work.












1. Introduction

To complete this section, write about:

✓ Scenario context

Industrial warehouses and shared spaces with humans and robots.

Need for autonomous following robots for logistics.

✓ Problem definition

Robot follows a dynamic target using only 2D LiDAR.

No maps, no planning.

Must stop at a defined safe distance.

✓ Assessment constraints

ROS 2 Jazzy

Gazebo Harmonic

Reactive behaviour only

Simulation-based performance

✓ Learning Outcomes

Write one paragraph connecting your robot to LO2, LO3, LO4.





2. System Design
2.1 Robot Description

You should explain:

It is a differential-drive robot (like Week 7).

URDF/Xacro includes:
base link, two wheels, inertial params, ros2_control plugin.

Why differential drive is good indoors (tight turning, simple control).
Include a screenshot of your robot model in Gazebo.

2.2 2D LiDAR Integration

Add:

LiDAR mounted at front-centre, horizontal plane.

Typical parameters: 270–360° FOV, 0.5–1° resolution.

ROS topic: /scan

Strengths: fast, good for distance measurement.

Weaknesses: no vertical detection, noise spikes, occlusion.

Include a visualisation screenshot.

2.3 Dynamic Environment

Describe:

Warehouse-style world (aisles, shelves, walls).

Human-target actor with a scripted walking pattern.

Additional moving obstacle (box, another agent).

Static hazards like corners.

State why this environment is realistic (crowded, narrow, unpredictable).

2.4 ROS 2 Architecture

This is a key scoring part. Explain:

Perception Node

Reads /scan

Filters front arc (e.g., −30° to +30°)

Computes nearest object

Publishes:
/target_detected, /target_distance, /safe_to_move

Control Node

Implements state machine: SEARCH → FOLLOW → STOP

Publishes /cmd_vel

Uses proportional control:
v = k * (distance - safety_distance)

Add a diagram of nodes & topics.

2.5 Control Architecture Justification

Write that reactive control was chosen because:

Low latency

Works well with noisy, dynamic environments

Easy to verify for safety

Planning is disallowed (fits constraints)

Contrast with why planning/SLAM were not required.










3. Behaviour Design & Algorithms
3.1 Target Detection Algorithm

Explain how you:

Read /scan

Filter angle region

Get minimum range

Ignore outliers

Fail if target not seen

Add pseudocode similar to the template.

3.2 Safety Thresholds

Include:

Example:
Safe distance = 0.8 m
Emergency stop = 0.5 m
Explain why dual thresholds reduce risk.

3.3 Follow Behaviour

Add proportional control behaviour:

Robot speeds up when far

Slows as it approaches safe distance

Velocity capped for safety

Smooth acceleration

3.4 State Machine

Include a diagram/table for the three states:

SEARCH: rotate slowly looking for target

FOLLOW: move forward with proportional control

STOP: hold position until target increases distance again

3.5 Dynamic Obstacle Handling

State that:

LiDAR can’t differentiate target vs obstacle

Unexpected objects trigger safety stop

This is a limitation of reactive design


















4. Evaluation
4.1 Methodology

Describe how you tested:

Different human-walking speeds

Sudden stops

Occlusions

Interference from obstacles

10–20 runs for reliability

4.2 Metrics Collected

Table with:

Min distance

Stop time

Overshoot

Time to reacquire

Collision count (should be 0)

Even if your sim logs are approximate, provide realistic numbers.

4.3 Results Discussion

Explain:

Safety distance maintained?

Did robot wobble?

Did reactive control overshoot?

Did it respond fast enough during sudden stop?

4.4 Limitations

Discuss:

LiDAR noise

No height info

Reactive control = jittery in clutter

Simulation simplifications

ros2_control delays























5. Ethical, Legal, Societal Discussion

Make sure you hit LO3 strongly.

5.1 Ethics

Discuss:

Safety as a core ethical requirement

Predictability

Responsibility when a robot follows someone

Slow speeds, safety buffers

Tie directly to your robot’s design choices.

5.2 Legal

Mention:

ISO 13482 (personal care robots)

ISO 10218 (industrial safety)

GDPR (if storing human data – here, LiDAR is non-identifying, so low risk)

5.3 Societal

Discuss:

Trust in robots

Cultural expectations

Impact on human workers

Why simple, conservative behaviour reduces anxiety

6. Reflection & Conclusion
Write about:

What worked well (reactive was responsive)

What was difficult (noise, occlusion, state switching)

If done in real world, what would break (clutter, narrow aisles, irregular human motion)

Conclusion:

Brief summary showing requirements → design → performance → future work.
