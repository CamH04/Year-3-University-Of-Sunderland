Justification of Lifecycle Selection
4.1 Criteria for Choosing an SDLC

Project complexity and size – larger projects may require more structure (e.g. V-Model or Spiral).

Requirement stability – if requirements are known and fixed, Waterfall may suffice; if evolving, Agile or Incremental preferred.

Risk level – Spiral or V-Model best for high-risk or safety-critical projects.

Customer involvement – Agile prioritises stakeholder collaboration.

Team expertise and culture – Agile requires self-organising, skilled teams.

Time constraints – Agile methods deliver working increments faster.

4.2 Example Justification Scenarios

Scenario 1: Government system requiring compliance and documentation → V-Model justified for traceability and quality assurance.

Scenario 2: Start-up developing a mobile app → Agile/Scrum justified for flexibility and rapid user feedback.

Scenario 3: Complex enterprise software with high uncertainty → Spiral Model justified for risk mitigation and iterative refinement.




7. Critical Evaluation of Methodologies
Strengths and Weaknesses Summary
Methodology	Strengths	Weaknesses
Waterfall	Simplicity, clear milestones	Inflexible, poor for change
V-Model	High assurance, testing discipline	Costly, rigid
Spiral	Risk-focused, iterative	Complex, resource-intensive
Incremental	Early value delivery	Integration challenges
Agile	Adaptive, customer-centric	Requires maturity, may lack documentation
DevOps	Fast delivery, automation	Cultural shift required
