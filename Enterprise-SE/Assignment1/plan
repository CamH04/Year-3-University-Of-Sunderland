    Justify design decisions relevant to how the system models client records and interactions.

Report (Methodology and Justification)

    Critically assess and justify the choice of software engineering lifecycles and development methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Waterfall).

    Support your discussion with academic sources and literature using Harvard referencing.

    Explain how the methodology supports the system design, implementation, evaluation, and continuous improvement.
