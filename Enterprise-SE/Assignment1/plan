Report (Methodology and Justification)

    Critically assess and justify the choice of software engineering lifecycles and development methodologies (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Waterfall).

    Support your discussion with academic sources and literature using Harvard referencing.

    Explain how the methodology supports the system design, implementation, evaluation, and continuous improvement.




2.3 Incremental Model

Software developed in small, functional increments.

Early delivery of partial systems; feedback integrated in later stages.

Balances structure and flexibility.





2.4 Spiral Model

Combines iterative development with risk management.

Four phases per cycle: planning, risk analysis, engineering, evaluation.

Strengths:

Explicit focus on risk assessment.

Useful for large, high-risk projects.

Weaknesses:

Complex to manage; costly for small projects.




2.5 Agile Lifecycle

Iterative and adaptive approach; emphasises collaboration, customer feedback, and incremental delivery.

Examples: Scrum, Kanban, Extreme Programming (XP).

Strengths:

Flexible and responsive to change.

Encourages stakeholder engagement and continuous improvement.

Early and frequent value delivery.

Weaknesses:

Requires high team discipline and communication.

Less predictability in cost and schedule for large projects.











3. Critical Comparison of Methodologies
3.1 Plan-Driven vs Agile
| Aspect                       | Plan-Driven (Waterfall, V-Model) | Agile (Scrum, XP, Kanban) |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Requirements**             | Fixed early                      | Evolving, iterative       |
| **Documentation**            | Comprehensive                    | Lightweight, adaptive     |
| **Testing**                  | Late stage                       | Continuous                |
| **Customer Involvement**     | Limited                          | Continuous feedback       |
| **Flexibility**              | Low                              | High                      |
| **Risk Handling**            | Predictive                       | Adaptive                  |
| **Project Size Suitability** | Large, regulated                 | Dynamic, small-medium     |
Plan-driven methodologies are suitable for predictable environments where compliance and traceability are key.

Agile methodologies are appropriate for uncertain or rapidly changing environments, emphasising adaptability and user value.






Justification of Lifecycle Selection
4.1 Criteria for Choosing an SDLC

Project complexity and size – larger projects may require more structure (e.g. V-Model or Spiral).

Requirement stability – if requirements are known and fixed, Waterfall may suffice; if evolving, Agile or Incremental preferred.

Risk level – Spiral or V-Model best for high-risk or safety-critical projects.

Customer involvement – Agile prioritises stakeholder collaboration.

Team expertise and culture – Agile requires self-organising, skilled teams.

Time constraints – Agile methods deliver working increments faster.

4.2 Example Justification Scenarios

Scenario 1: Government system requiring compliance and documentation → V-Model justified for traceability and quality assurance.

Scenario 2: Start-up developing a mobile app → Agile/Scrum justified for flexibility and rapid user feedback.

Scenario 3: Complex enterprise software with high uncertainty → Spiral Model justified for risk mitigation and iterative refinement.






5. Integration of Design, Implementation, and Evaluation
5.1 Design

Agile promotes emergent design — evolves as understanding deepens.

Waterfall promotes up-front design — complete design before coding.

Critical assessment: emergent design can lead to innovation but risks architectural drift; upfront design ensures consistency but may limit adaptability.

5.2 Implementation

Agile practices (e.g. test-driven development, continuous integration) enhance code quality and speed.

Plan-driven models rely on formal coding standards and phase completion.

5.3 Evaluation

Evaluation (testing and validation) varies:

In Waterfall, testing follows implementation.

In Agile, testing is continuous and integrated.

Agile metrics: velocity, customer satisfaction, defect rates.

Plan-driven metrics: schedule variance, defect density, requirements traceability.








6. Emerging and Hybrid Approaches
6.1 DevOps

Integrates development and operations for continuous delivery and deployment.

Builds on Agile principles; emphasises automation, monitoring, and feedback.

Justification: reduces cycle time and improves deployment reliability.

6.2 Agile-Waterfall Hybrid

Combines plan-driven structure with Agile flexibility.

Example: Waterfall for initial requirements and architecture, Agile for implementation.

Suitable for large organisations transitioning from traditional to Agile environments.

6.3 Model-Driven and Continuous Engineering

Model-driven engineering (MDE) automates parts of design and implementation using models.

Continuous engineering integrates feedback loops across lifecycle stages.





7. Critical Evaluation of Methodologies
Strengths and Weaknesses Summary
Methodology	Strengths	Weaknesses
Waterfall	Simplicity, clear milestones	Inflexible, poor for change
V-Model	High assurance, testing discipline	Costly, rigid
Spiral	Risk-focused, iterative	Complex, resource-intensive
Incremental	Early value delivery	Integration challenges
Agile	Adaptive, customer-centric	Requires maturity, may lack documentation
DevOps	Fast delivery, automation	Cultural shift required
